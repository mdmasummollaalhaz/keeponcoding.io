It allows you to efficiently work through the most common variations of problems asked by top-tier companies without having to spend hours 'battling' an algorithm only to come up with an inefficient or incorrect solution. There are a lot of resources available for repetition, but AlgoExpert differentiates its product by providing the 'how' and 'why' in clear and concise videos. Developing a deeper understanding of how to approach these problems is better than trying to memorize lines of code. I highly recommend AlgoExpert."
